mint
====

Small python script to check the balance of mint.com accounts.

## .mintrc example:

A .mintrc file will be created automatically if one does not already exist.

```ini
[user]
email = mint.user@email.com
password = mypassword123
```

I have only linked my bank account to mint.com, so I am unable to check if
this script can parse other types of account information. Please feel free
to fork this project on [github] if you would like to contribute!
